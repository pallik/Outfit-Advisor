In this thesis we analyzed existing methods of color harmony rating, processing clothing images and generating clothing combinations. Based on this analysis we proposed algorithms for clothing image processing - background removing and dominant color extraction, and an algorithm for generating new clothing combinations according to specified parameters. We generated clothing combinations in two phases. At first we generate clothing combinations according to selected dress code using labeled data with real clothing combinations for specified dress code and sex. Next we select best generated clothing combinations based on color harmony rating using regression model which is trained by a large number of user-rated color palettes. Accepting or refusing generated combinations trains our algorithm.

We implemented our proposed algorithms as mobile application for platform iOS.
